            an electrical and electronics engineer who loves doodling. I started doodling for fun on notebooks during boring lectures, which evolved into an interest in graphic design as I began working with Photoshop and Illustrator. Over the years, my doodling canvas has expanded from notebooks to walls, shoes, speakers, and the digital domain.

Currently, I am working as a UI developer at Skellam AI, Banglore.
